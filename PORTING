The SAE module, sae.c, is OS-independent. The OS-specific portion
of this release is <os>/meshd.c. Porting SAE to a different OS requires
definition of a new meshd.c module for the new OS. Each <os>/meshd.c
must:

  1. manage a wireless interface-- set the ssid, set the band, set
     the channel, et cetera.
  2. receive beacons and authentication frames in an OS-specific
     manner. 
  3. be capable of sending authentication frames over the wireless
     interface. 

A generic service model, service.[ch], is included to allow <os>/meshd.c
to manage socket interfaces and sae to manage timers. Replacement of
service.[ch] with a different service model should be trivial. 

os_glue.h defines the external API each <os>/meshd.c must have
to allow SAE to use to send frames over the air. These are:

  - int meshd_write_mgmt(char *frame, int len)

	To send a management frame over the air

  - void fin(unsigned short status, unsigned char *peer_mac, 
	      unsigned char *key, int keylen)

	To obtain notification of termination of sae. The status
	is defined in ieee802_11.h and, if zero, a key will be
	returned for the specified MAC address.

	<os>/meshd.c must make a local copy of this key if it wants to
	manipulate it for any reason.

sae.h defines the routines each <os>/meshd.c must call to enable SAE
authentication.

  - int sae_initialize(char *ssid, char *config_directory)

	This must be called first, before any processing is done. It
	allows SAE to configure itself.

  - int process_mgmt_frame(struct ieee80211_mgmt_frame *frame, int len, 
                           unsigned char *local_mac_addr);

	Used to send beacons and authentiction frames to SAE for
	processing.

  - void sae_read_config(int signal)

	This is a helper routine that can be used to catch HUP, or
	<os>/meshd.c can catch HUP itself and call this routine
	if an sa_handler(int) action is not supported by the OS.

	It re-reads the SAE configuration without having to stop
	and re-start meshd.

void sae_dump_db (int signal);

	This is a routine that can be used to catch USR1, or 
	<os>/meshd.c can catch USR1 itself and call this routine
	if an sa_handler(int) action is not supported by the OS.

	This prints all peer instances and their current state of
	negotiation.
